# wrdExtractr Exercise

## Overview
The wrdExtractr is a small projecct that i worked on while completing the Hack The Box Academy: Introduction to Python3 Module.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to utilize what I learned from the module to create a script that does the following:

- Find all words on the page, ignoring HTML tags and other metadata.
- Count the occurrence of each word and note it down.
- Sort by occurrence.
- Do something with the most frequently occurring words, e.g., print them.

## Note:
I used this project as an opportunity to become familiar with Python3 but also get familiar with programming and using Git/Github.

## How it works
- The code will download and print the entire HTML of a webpage.
- The URL of the webpage is fixed inside the code.
- Uses the requests library.
